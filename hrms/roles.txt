to be previewed for the boss and employee in the form of a crossed record along with the signum / nickname of the person who made the modification)

- manually add the time of arrival and departure, which should be marked in the system as a manual intervention

User cannot:
- modify tables and records that do not result from his qualifications = Admin - User (see above)


In general, users should be given as little permission for everything as possible. They only have to use the data prepared by the admin, not
do nothing yourself.
